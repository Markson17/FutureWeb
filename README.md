## Introduction
Welcome to Spendec, a revolutionary Web5 expense tracker app that empowers users with control over their financial data while providing comprehensive insights and personalized guidance. This project is developed as part of the DevCareer Web5 Hackathon by team FutureWeb and represents our vision for the future of decentralized financial management.
